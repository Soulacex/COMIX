Comix is an app used to track a comic book collection.

A comic book has the following attributes. A * indicates that the attribute is optional (may be empty/blank):


- Publisher, e.g. "Marvel", "Image", etc.
- Series Title, e.g. "The Magnificent Ms. Marvel"
- Volume Number
- Issue Number
- Publication Date
- Creators*
- Principle Characters* 
- Description*
- Value ($$)*


The app will provide a searchable database of comics.

The database is immutable - the content of the database cannot be changed by the user.


The database provides the following fields:


- Series (Title) - may contain volume number, e.g. "Spider-Man, vol. 2". If no volume number is specified, assume that it is volume 1.
- Issue Number
- Story Title
- Publisher
- Publication (Release) Date
- Creators


The user shall be able to search for comics using partial or exact matches to any field. For example, a partial search for series titles using the term "Hulk" should return comics that have "Hulk" anywhere in the title, e.g. "Hulk", "She-Hulk", "The Incredible Hulk", "The Indestructible Hulk", "The Immortal Hulk", etc.

Searches are always case-insensitive.

The user shall be able to maintain a personal collection by:

- Adding comics from the database
- Adding comics by manually entering information
Removing comics
- Editing the attributes of comics already in the collection
- Marking a comic as "graded" on a scale of 1 to 10. The value of a graded comic is adjusted according to the following formula:
  - 1 = value * 0.10
  - 2-10 = log10(grade) * value
- Marking a graded comic as "slabbed." This doubles the value of the comic. To be clear, a comic cannot be slabbed unless it is also graded.

The user should be able to browse their personal collection.

The personal collection is organized into a hierarchy:
-   The entire collection
- Publishers
- Series
-   Volumes
-   Individual Issues

The following statistics should be displayed at every level while browsing the collection:

-   Number of issues
-   Value

The user should be able to execute a search for comics in the collection:

-   Any search terms should be matched against any of the following fields: series title, principle characters, creator names, description


-   The user should be able to specify whether exact matches are required or if partial matches are acceptable. For example, a partial title search for "Spider-Man" would return comics with titles like "Spider-Man", "The Amazing Spider-Man", "Miles Morales: Spider-Man", "Ultimate Spider-Man" and so on.


- Search results should be sortable by:
    -   Series Title, Volume, & Issue Number (default)
    -   Publication Date

Additional sort options may be required in later releases


## Non-Functional Requirements

The initial version of the application must provide a plain text user interface (PTUI) through which a user may interact with the application using simple, menu-driven commands. There may be requirements for additional user interfaces (e.g. desktop, web, mobile) in future iterations of the product.
The user's profile must be stored persistently between restarts of the application.
You have been provided with a database of available comics in CSV format. You may copy the data into another format, but you must maintain all of the data.
Implementing a "real" database is optional - you may use text/CSV files to store data. If you do implement a real database, your releases must include complete, step-by-step setup instructions.
